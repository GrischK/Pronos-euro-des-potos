# Pronos des potos 🫱🫲

https://pronosdespotos.com/

This is app, built for my friends, offers the opportunity to make predictions for Euro 2024 competition.

The idea is to make prediction for all matches before each tournament stage ('mes pronos' page).

When you have made your predictions, you can have a resume with all users predictions ('tous les pronos' page).

On ranking page ('classement' page) you can see user sorted by total points. 

* 0 point if you did wrong result prediction 💩
* 1 point if good result but not the right score 😏
* 3 points if good result, right score but at least one user did the same prediction 👌
* 4 points if you are the only one with good result and right score 💪

An admin page allows to manage prediction status to lock them when the stage begins. 

This app is a side-project, built in 1 and half month, during free time, then my apologizes for dirty code somewhere... 😶‍🌫️🤐

Lot of hotfixes as I tried to test the app with Champions League data. 

Will try to improve it for next tournament, World Cup 2026. ⚽🏆
